        <h1 class="question">Thank you for being the best girlfriend. . .&#9825;</h1>
        <p>My little baby, I just wanted to tell you that I love you so much. I love how you always remember little
            things about me. I love how you are always toughtful and considerate. I love how you check up on me to make
            sure everything is okay when I am feeling down. I love how we can feel each others energy without saying
            anything (you do it better xd). I love your beautiful eyes. Your cute little laugh. Your beautiful blonde
            hair that is made in heaven. I love your soul. Remember you tell me "You are the love of my life"? Bebek you
            are the love of my life here on Earth and love of my afterlife on the other side as well, and this will
            never change. You are my angel and I thank God everyday I wake that I have you by myside. I am the luckiest
            man alive on earth. I could never change you for anything. You are my everything and I wanted to let you
            know that I appreciate everything you do A LOT. You make my life way better. You are my little babyyy. I
            know that sometimes (rarely) we might encounter some disagreements -which is common in relationships- but I
            want you to know that I will always be there for you. I will always be there to support you. I will alwasy
            be there to love you. I will always be there to make you happy. I will always be there to make you feel
            special. I will always be there to make you feel loved...
            <br>
            The words are not enough to express how much I love and appreicate you. They are not enough to express how
            happy and luck I am. I love you so much. I love you more than anything in this world. You are mine, and I am
            yours. I wish to have many more Valentine's Days with you. And again, thank you for being the best
            girlfriend ever.
